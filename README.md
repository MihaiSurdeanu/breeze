# Breeze [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/scalanlp/breeze.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/scalanlp/breeze)

Breeze is a library for numerical processing. It aims to be generic, clean, and powerful without sacrificing (much) efficiency.

The current version is 0.6-SNAPSHOT. The latest release is 0.5.2. 
## Documentation

* https://github.com/scalanlp/breeze/wiki/Quickstart
* https://github.com/scalanlp/breeze/wiki/Breeze-Linear-Algebra
* https://github.com/scalanlp/breeze/wiki/UserGuide
* [Scaladoc](http://www.scalanlp.org/api/#breeze.package)

Note:  

Breeze used to have more components, but they are getting sharded out to different libraries. Their new homes are described below:

* breeze-viz: a (barely maintained) visualization library in its own repository. It is available at [https://github.com/scalanlp/breeze-viz](https://github.com/scalanlp/breeze-viz).
* breeze-learn (machine learning) is now in [Nak](https://github.com/scalanlp/nak).
* breeze-process (natural language processing) has become [Chalk](https://github.com/scalanlp/chalk).

## Using Breeze

### Building it yourself.

This project can be built with sbt 0.13

### SBT

For **SBT**, Add these lines to your SBT project definition:

* For SBT versions 0.10.x or later

```scala
libraryDependencies  ++= Seq(
            // other dependencies here
            "org.scalanlp" % "breeze_2.10" % "0.5.2",
            // in a different repository now (github.com/scalanlp/breeze-viz)
            "org.scalanlp" % "breeze-viz_2.10" % "0.5.2"
)

resolvers ++= Seq(
            // other resolvers here
            // if you want to use snapshot builds (currently 0.6-SNAPSHOT), use this.
            "Sonatype Snapshots" at "https://oss.sonatype.org/content/repositories/snapshots/",
            "Sonatype Releases" at "https://oss.sonatype.org/content/repositories/releases/"
)

// Scala 2.9.2 is still supported for 0.2.1, but is dropped afterwards.
// Don't use an earlier version of 2.10, you will probably get weird compiler crashes.
scalaVersion := "2.10.3"
```

### Maven

Maven looks like this:

```xml
<dependency>
  <groupId>org.scalanlp</groupId>
	<artifactId>breeze_2.10</artifactId>
	<version>0.5.2</version>
</dependency>
```

### Other build tools

http://mvnrepository.com/artifact/org.scalanlp/breeze-math_2.10/0.5 (as an example) is a great resource for finding other configuration examples for other build tools.

See documentation (linked below!) for more information on using Breeze.

## History

Breeze is the merger of the ScalaNLP and Scalala projects, because one of the original maintainers is unable to continue development. The Scalala parts are largely rewritten.
